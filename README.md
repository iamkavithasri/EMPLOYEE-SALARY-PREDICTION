# ðŸ“Š*Project Overview*

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds or it is below 50K annually based on demographic and work-related features, using the Adult Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## The solution involves:
-Preprocessing the data (handling missing values, encoding, feature selection)

-Training multiple machine learning models using Scikit-learn Pipelines

-Selecting the best-performing model (Gradient Boosting Classifier)

## Deploying the final model using a Streamlit web application that supports both:
-Real-time prediction via sidebar input

-Batch prediction via CSV upload

This application serves as a practical example of end-to-end ML deployment, combining data analysis, model training, and user interaction in one cohesive system.
